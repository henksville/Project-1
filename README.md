# Project-1
Project Title: 
Computer Science II - Final Project.  
 
Project content: (Runtime at the bottom of the document) 
 
User class   --the main.cpp should allow the user to enter their name  
 
Functionality: prompts user to enter their username and welcomes user by the username  
 
Song class/struct (in the playlist class)   - title   - genre   - duration   - artist   - likes 
 
Functionality: allows the user to be able to enter all the information above for songs they want in  their playlist 
 
Playlist class    -the main.cpp should allow the user to give the load a set of songs &    - give this playlist a name 
 
Functionality: loads the songs the user entered and allows the user to name the playlist 
 
Sort class   - this class contains all of the sort functions 
 
Functionality: using merge sort, selection sort, and insertion sort to display the playlist in different order  
 
Readme File - the readme.txt contains where all the code is located - it is just the directory structure of your code 
- it also contains runtime complexity information for all of your program/application. 
 
Algorithm used to make the code work:  
● Create an instance of the User and Playlist classes  
● Create variables to store and allocate data values to each variables in the SONG struct (title, genre, duration, artist, likes) 
● Get user information  
● Print menu and allow user choose from one of the options available  
● Create switch statements to define what will happen for each option  
● For case 1, create a variable of type ifstream and import the values from the “playlist.txt” text file into the variables created in the second step  
● Use random number function to assign random numbers to variable containing song likes 
● Create an integer array and use a loop to store all the likes generated by the random number function into the array  
● Use one of the sorting algorithms in the Sort.cpp and Sort.h files to sort these numbers  
● Use nested loops to map these numbers back to the nodes in the linked list by creating another instance of the linked list (Playlist class) and appending when the values are equal 
● Print the second instance of the linked list, which will print the nodes sorted according to number of likes.
